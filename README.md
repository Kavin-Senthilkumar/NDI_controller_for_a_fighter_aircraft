##  NDI Controller for a Fighter Aircraft

### Description
This project aims to design and implement a controller for a fighter aircraft using the Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) technique, referred to here as the "NDI Controller". NDI is a powerful control method that uses a system's natural nonlinear behavior to achieve accurate and reliable control, making it ideal for the fast-changing and complex conditions of fighter aircraft. The goal is to develop a simulation or prototype that demonstrates the controller's ability to stabilize and maneuver the aircraft under various flight conditions.

### Motivation
Fighter aircraft operate in highly dynamic and unpredictable environments, requiring precise and robust control systems. Traditional linear control methods often struggle to handle the nonlinear dynamics of high-performance aircraft, especially during aggressive maneuvers or extreme conditions. The NDI Controller leverages the aircraft's nonlinear dynamics to provide superior stability and responsiveness, potentially improving safety and performance in combat scenarios.

### Objectives
- Design a NDI based control system for a fighter aircraft
- Simulate the controller's performance under diverse flight conditions (e.g., high-G maneuvers, turbulence, or stall recovery)
- Validate the controller's ability to maintain stability and achieve desired maneuvers.
- Compare NDI performance against traditional control methods

### Key featurs
- Nonlinear control tailored to fighter aircraft dynamics.
- Real-time adaptability to changing flight conditions.
- Robust stabilization during extreme maneuvers.
- Modular design for integration into existing flight simulation frameworks.
